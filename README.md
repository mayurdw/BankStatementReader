## Bank Statement Reader App

The Android app should be able to read ASB Bank's CSV bank statement, report on what is expense, what is income. 

Additionally, it should store old transaction records, use the past records to see if any new records from the file need to be asked about. 


### Things TODO:

- [] Create Room Database

- [] Create Fragment for confirming Transaction Type

- [] Use cases for CSV Parsing?

- [] Put file reading operations in a coroutine
